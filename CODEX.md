## 1. Overview & Release Criteria

### **Mission Statement**

Transition the `userscripts` project from "pre-release" to "production release" state, ready for public consumption, contribution, and audit. All code and project components must adhere to best practices, be security reviewed, and present a frictionless onboarding and usage experience.

**Release Criteria:**

* All scripts function as intended on their target sites under multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium-based).
* No unresolved critical bugs, regressions, or high-severity vulnerabilities.
* Comprehensive README and per-script documentation.
* CI for code style and automated linting.
* Reproducible, versioned release artifacts.
* Transparent, cross-referenced task tracking and audit trails.
* Onboarding, contribution, and roadmap guidance for future maintainers.

---

## 2. General Engineering & Codebase Audit

### **2.1 Repository Structure & Organization**

* [ ] **Audit File Tree:** Confirm scripts, README, and `/testing` directory structure is optimal.
* [ ] **Meta-data Consistency:** All scripts must have up-to-date metadata (`@name`, `@namespace`, `@author`, `@match`, `@description`, `@grant`, `@license`, etc).
* [ ] **Naming Consistency:** File and script names should follow established naming conventions (`4ndr0tools-*`).
* [ ] **Testing Folder:** Ensure `/testing` directory contains only experimental or non-release-ready scripts.

### **2.2 Modern JS & Style**

* [ ] **ES6+ Features:** Use `let`/`const`, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, etc.
* [ ] **Strict Mode:** All scripts should have `'use strict';` at the top.
* [ ] **Code Formatting:** Apply Prettier or ESLint with project-wide config.
* [ ] **Single Responsibility:** Each userscript should do "one thing well".

---

## 3. Core Script-by-Script Audit & Refactor

### **3.1 Audit, Refactor & Test Each Script**

#### **Action Plan:**

For each script in the root directory (`4ndr0tools-*.user.js`):

* [ ] **Functionality Test:** Manual and automated tests on all supported browsers and target sites.
* [ ] **Code Review:** Peer review for clarity, maintainability, and modularity.
* [ ] **Security Review:** See Section 4.
* [ ] **Lint & Format:** Ensure compliance with project style guide.
* [ ] **Metadata Audit:** Confirm all required `@grant`, `@license`, etc.
* [ ] **GM Compatibility:** Confirm `GM_*` calls are safe and required.
* [ ] **Comments & Docstrings:** Clear inline documentation for every function and major logic block.
* [ ] **Performance Review:** Ensure no excessive polling, observers, or resource usage.

**Sample Scripts for Explicit Review:**

* `4ndr0tools-SelectAllCheckboxes.user.js`

  * Ensure robust checkbox detection, range select, and cross-framework compatibility (native, React, etc).
* `4ndr0tools-Pixverse++.user.js`

  * Red-team level code review (auth token handling, fetch/XHR monkeypatching, and UI security).
* `4ndr0tools-YtdlcProtocol.user.js`

  * Test custom protocol handling across Linux distros and user environments.
* `4ndr0tools-YouTubeEmbedRedirectButton.user.js`

  * UI/UX placement, button visibility on all YT themes and layouts.

#### **Testing Directory (`/testing`)**

* [ ] **Cull or Graduate:** Remove obsolete scripts or promote fully working scripts to main directory after audit.
* [ ] **Document Testing Results:** Add comments and/or a changelog for each script in testing.

---

## 4. Security, Privacy, and Sandbox Compliance

### **4.1 Security Audit**

* [ ] **@inject-into Usage:** Remove or minimize use. Where necessary (e.g. for fetch monkeypatching), use injected scripts plus `window.postMessage` for sandbox-page comms.
* [ ] **No Sensitive Data in Global Scope:** All auth tokens, retry states, etc. must be in closure scope, not `window` or `unsafeWindow`.
* [ ] **GM\_* Storage:*\* Audit what is stored. Document any potential for leaks.
* [ ] **No Untrusted `innerHTML`:** Use `textContent` unless absolutely required; sanitize if dynamic HTML is injected.
* [ ] **Origin Hardening:** Avoid use of wildcards in `@match` that could target untrusted origins.
* [ ] **Security Documentation:** README must include a section on security model, including risks of userscript context and `@inject-into`.

### **4.2 Privacy Audit**

* [ ] **No Unintended Data Exfiltration:** No remote logging of user data, no third-party analytics in codebase.
* [ ] **Respect User Sessions:** Scripts should not break target site login/session flows.
* [ ] **Prompt for Destructive Actions:** Any script that performs mass actions (deletion, form submission, etc.) must confirm with user.

---

## 5. Automation, Testing, and QA

### **5.1 Automated Testing**

* [ ] **Test Harness:** Create basic test harness (could be Puppeteer scripts, or headless browser tests for UI components).
* [ ] **Cross-Browser Matrix:** Firefox (Violentmonkey, Tampermonkey), Chromium (Chrome, Edge, Brave), Greasemonkey where supported.

### **5.2 Manual QA Checklist**

* [ ] **Installation:** Easy, single-click install from userscripts repo or GreasyFork/Userscripts.org mirror.
* [ ] **Functionality:** Confirm main function works on all target sites, including edge cases and dark/light themes.
* [ ] **Uninstall/Cleanup:** Script must not leave persistent side effects after uninstall.

### **5.3 Regression Testing**

* [ ] **Prior Releases:** Compare with previous versions to ensure no features regressed.

---

## 6. Documentation, Metadata, and UX Consistency

### **6.1 README.md**

* [ ] **Project Overview:** What/Why/How of the userscripts collection.
* [ ] **Per-Script Index:** Each script listed with description, features, supported sites, and known caveats.
* [ ] **Usage Instructions:** Install, configure, troubleshoot.
* [ ] **Security & Privacy Statement:** As per Section 4.
* [ ] **Contributing Guidelines:** PR, Issues, and Code Style instructions.
* [ ] **Changelog:** Summary of recent changes and known issues.

### **6.2 Per-Script Metadata & Inline Docs**

* [ ] **All scripts must include:**

  * `@name`, `@namespace`, `@version`, `@description`, `@author`
  * `@match`, `@exclude` as precise as possible
  * `@license` (MIT, Unlicense, or compatible open license)
  * `@grant` statements audited for minimal permission set
  * Maintainer contact or project repo in `@namespace` or `@supportURL`

---

## 7. Infrastructure & DevOps

### **7.1 Linting and Style**

* [ ] **Prettier/ESLint:** Enforce via pre-commit hooks or CI pipeline.

### **7.2 Automated Release**

* [ ] **Release Workflow:** GitHub Actions or similar to tag, bundle, and deploy releases.
* [ ] **CI/CD:** Tests must pass before release tagging.
* [ ] **Versioning:** Use Semantic Versioning (SemVer) across all scripts.
* [ ] **Automated Changelog:** Generate summary from commit logs.

### **7.3 Deployment**

* [ ] **Mirror:** Optionally, scripts may be mirrored to GreasyFork or OpenUserJS for broader visibility.

---

## 8. Release Notes & Versioning

* [ ] **Release Notes:** Write draft notes summarizing:

  * Major features per script
  * Security/privacy updates
  * Known issues and workarounds
  * Contribution acknowledgments
  * Link to project and contributing guidelines

---

## 9. Roadmap: Further Enhancements

* [ ] **Internationalization:** Add support for multiple languages/locales (via config or auto-detect).
* [ ] **Automated Updates:** Integrate update checks or auto-push to user script directories.
* [ ] **Script Configuration UI:** Where applicable, offer a UI to toggle script options (e.g., via Tampermonkey menus or in-page panels).
* [ ] **Centralized Settings Store:** For advanced users, allow settings to be synced across scripts via a shared key/value store.
* [ ] **Accessibility:** Ensure all injected UI is screen-reader friendly and works with keyboard navigation.
* [ ] **Extensive Edge Case Testing:** More coverage for rarely used browsers/environments.

## **Appendix: Academic Rationale**

* **Modularity:** Ensures ease of maintenance, bug isolation, and onboarding for new contributors (ref: *Modular Programming* \[Parnas, 1972]).
* **Security:** Userscripts are highly privileged and often run on sensitive sessions; closure scope, minimal injection, and strict origin scoping are essential to mitigate XSS/data theft (ref: *OWASP Top Ten*).
* **CI/CD:** Continuous integration, testing, and release automation are now industry standard for open source quality and trust (ref: *Accelerate*, Forsgren et al., 2018).
* **Documentation:** High-quality open source projects are defined by clear, up-to-date docs and a transparent contribution path (ref: *The Cathedral and the Bazaar*, Raymond, 1999).
* **Accessibility/Internationalization:** Growing open source usage means scripts must be usable by non-English speakers and people with disabilities.
